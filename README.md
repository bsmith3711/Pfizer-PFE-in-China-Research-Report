# Pfizer-PFE-in-China-Research-Report
A comprehensive research report on Pfizer (PFE) with a focus on its operations in China

This is a research report I compiled (ironically) pre-COVID.

The report is geo-focused on China, and specifcally on the country's againg population and how Pfizer is uniquely suited to benefit in such a market.

The conclusion of my report is that PFE stock is a buy as it's potential in China is undervalued.
